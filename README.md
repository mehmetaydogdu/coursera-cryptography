Coursera Maryland Cryptography

These are my programming assignment solutions written in Scala.


##NOTICE
These solutions are for reference only and should not be viewed by students currently enrolled in the course.  Students who view solutions to homework and programming assignments that they have not yet completed deprive themselves of learning and understanding.

**If you read these solutions before completing the course, you will diminish the course's value for yourself and others.**
